I had a few issues deploying this on cloudflare pages (free web hosting), as it would not load the images in the textures folder which resulted in the planet looking
ridiculous. As a result of being unable to resolve the issue I have redirected the benmarr.co.uk domain to go to this page.
Eventually I will pay for hosting...but until then:

* Clone the repo. 

* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
