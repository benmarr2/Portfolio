        <p>
          LDRA is known for its flagship code-analysis toolsuite. My job, in the
          analysis team, is to work on the development of a static and dynamic
          code analysis tool.
          <br /><br />
          This tool allows businesses to develop high quality C/C++ and ADA95
          code that adheres to strict coding compliance standards such as MISRA
          C and ISO26262. The testbed allows developers and team leaders to
          analyse their code and see exactly where in the code they violate
          these coding standards.
          <br /><br />
          The coding standards exist primarily for safety and mission critical
          software. For example, the control system of a F-35 fighter jet or a
          manned rocket headed to space.
          <br /><br />
          LDRA's clients include NASA, The China Manned Spacecraft Program,
          Lockheed Martin and some of the biggest names in automotive industry.

        <p>
          My job at Serco was to answer calls for the Government Warm Home
          Discount scheme, a DWP benefit that helped elderly UK citizens get
          discounted heating. Here I also helped to train some of the less
          tech-savvy employees who were part of my team.

          Liverpool Mutual Homes was where I completed my university placement.
          Here my job was to provide 1st line support to a large housing
          organisation‚Äôs business requirements. I also had the opportunity to
          shadow a full-stack developer and gain insight into what a commercial
          programming environment looks like.

        <p>
          I worked in two restaraunts part time as a chef. Cooking has always
          been a passion of mine so chefing seemed like a good way to earn some
          money whilst I was finishing my studies in university. Chefing is
          definitely the most challenging but rewarding jobs I have ever done.

          Before I made a career u-turn (albeit the best decision I ever made!),
          I studied chemistry and secured a job as a laboratory technician for a
          company called Cargill. Here I provided plant critical analysis to two
          edible oil processing facilities and worked with some cutting-edge
          analytical equipment.

        <h2>üìï What did I study at Liverpool Hope University?</h2>
        <h4 class="jobTitle">Bachelors Degree in Computer Science - First Class</h4>
        <p>
          To summarise, the final year of my degree was focused on emerging
          technologies in computer science, this was done via three modules. The
          intelligent systems module taught us about artificial intelligence and
          virtual reality. The advanced web development module was focused on
          JavaScript and how increasingly demanding applications can run in web
          browsers. The mobile development module concentrated on programming
          for mobile and IoT devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my dissertation, I developed an educational visual representation
          of how Blockchain works - the digital ledger that powers bitcoin and
          many other cryptocurrencies, in a web browser using react.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first and second years were focused more on developing a solid
          understanding of how computers work on a fundamental level and how
          humans and computers interact with one another, along with software
          development methodologies such as Rapid Application Development (RAD).
