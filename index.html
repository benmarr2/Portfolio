        <h2>‚úé About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Computer Science graduate seeking employment as a junior
          developer, based in Liverpool, UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a recent graduate, I am seeking an opportunity to widen my
          experience and play a key role within a business. The perfect place
          for me would be somewhere that I can develop my technical skillset
          amongst like-minded people. A company that will get the best out of me
          and allows me to bridge the gap between graduate and professional in
          the most efficient way possible.
        </p>

        <h2>üìï What did I study at Liverpool Hope University?</h2>
        <h4>Bachelors Degree in Computer Science - First Class</h4>
        <p>
          To summarise, the final year of my degree was focused on emerging
          technologies in computer science, this was done via three modules. The
          intelligent systems module taught us about artificial intelligence and
          virtual reality. The advanced web development module was focused on
          JavaScript and how increasingly demanding applications can run in web
          browsers. The mobile development module concentrated on
          programming for mobile and IoT devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my dissertation, I developed an educational visual representation of how Blockchain works - the digital ledger that powers bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, in a web browser using react. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My first and second years were focused more on developing a solid
          understanding of how computers work on a fundamental level and how
          humans and computers interact with one another, along with software
          development methodologies such as Rapid Application Development (RAD).

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>Serco - Customer Service Advisor (2021) üéß</h3>
        <p>
          My job at Serco was to answer calls for the Government Warm Home Discount scheme, a DWP benefit that helped elderly UK citizens get discounted heating. Here I also helped to train some of the less tech-savvy employees who were part of my team. 
        </p>
        <h3>Liverpool Mutual Homes - University Placement Student(2020) üíª</h3>
        <p>
          Liverpool Mutual Homes was where I completed my university placement. Here my job was to provide 1st line support to a large housing organisation‚Äôs business requirements. I also had the opportunity to shadow a full-stack developer and gain insight into what a commercial programming environment looks like.
        </p>
        <h3>Gustum & Rox (2020) üë®‚Äçüç≥</h3>
        <p>
          I worked in two restaraunts part time as a chef. Cooking has always been a passion of mine so chefing seemed like a good way to earn some money whilst I was finishing my studies in university. Chefing is definitely the most challenging but rewarding jobs I have ever done. 
        </p>
        <h3>Cargill (2017) üß™ </h3>
        <p>
          Before I made a career u-turn (albeit the best decision I ever made!),
          I studied chemistry and secured a job as a laboratory technician for a
          company called Cargill. Here I provided plant critical analysis to two
          edible oil processing facilities and worked with some cutting-edge
          analytical equipment.
